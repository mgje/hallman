There are 48 members of the course organization, but only 29 of them have bothered to make a sub repository at the course reposityory, with an average of 9 commits per repo.

Apart from the first week, the day with the least amount of commits is saturday and overall sundays have the least amount of total commits.
 
Also, Britta Doesnt know how to push to the course repo, delaying our progress by at least half an hour and forcing everybody to implement a "try" when getting repo data.
